Wow, just wandered out of O'Dessa and into the cold night air, can't even tell if it’s the popcorn in my teeth making me feel gritty or if it’s the   that's still bouncing around my skull. It’s one of those 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮𝘴 that punches you in the gut but in a good way, like a friendly clown with a sugar high whose idea of humor crosses into existential.

The screen lit up with such colors, like a mad trapeze show but darker, like if shadows learned to dance on tightropes. My back was aching from the seat, but my soul felt on fire. Seriously though, the explosions of color and that soundtrack, like if a circus band crashed into a techno rave, left my brain doing cartwheels. 

> There was this scene, with her just standing there, looking out over that weird post-apocalyptic skyline as if she could see each note the city played. It made me think of juggling - you know, everything up in the air but somehow you can't drop anything or the world ends.

I swear I tasted the screen - the electric tang of neon and the bittersweet grit of popcorn, both fighting for attention. Everyone in the theater was so noisy, but somehow it was part of the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮, like the chatter was another character. It's like they took a mirror and made it a window, but one covered in circus flyers, torn and faded.

Someone told me to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  , and I was like, how do you capture a moment of chaos in a file? Just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   for the chaos - you have to be there to feel it 𝘭𝘦𝘢𝘬ing into your head, like the smell of popcorn too old.

And the character's journey was like, uh, the high wire act that just kept swaying in the breeze. Seems wild but make sense at some moral level. I can't even tell if half of it was real or if I’m just still seeing circus elephants dancing whenever I close my eyes.

It didn't try to be anything it wasn’t, like some  s do when they try on shoes that are too big, and then trip over the popcorn scattered like stars on the floor. I mean, there’s art, and then there’s this - like the painting is still wet and someone smudged it just for fun.

console.fog(invalid string(&^%); let elephant = juggler.length[]; return circusDreams;
